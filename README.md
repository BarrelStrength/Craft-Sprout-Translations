# Sprout Plugins - Translations

Sprout Plugins are designed to be translated into your language of choice. This repository contains the most recent English translation file we know of for each plugin. 

If you translate one of our plugins into another language, please let us know or submit a pull request and we will happily add your translation to the repository.

_Note: We are working on getting a better process in place to make these updates more consistent with the plugin releases._

## The translation files

The English translation file is stored in the `pluginname/translations` folder for each plugin along with any other translations that we know of for the plugin.

## Translating a plugin into your language

In this example we will use Sprout Forms.

1. Copy the translation file from sproutforms/translations/en_us.php
2. Rename the file to your chosen language: `en_us.php` => `nl.php`
3. Update the file to include your translations:

- en_us.php: 'Add a form' => 'Add a form',
- nl.php: 'Add a form' => 'Formulier toevoegen',

4. Copy your new translation file to your `sproutforms/translations` folder.
